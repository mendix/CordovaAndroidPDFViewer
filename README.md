# Cordova Android PDF Viewer

This widget allows you to view PDFs from within your cordova app on Android. Whereas IOS has support for this out of the box, Android is a little more difficult as it doesn't offer any PDF viewer out of the box. This widget depends on the Sitewaerts cordova plugin and viewer to embed a view.

Note that this widget will *only* work on Android and is not supported for any other platform.
This widget requires the following cordova plugins to be installed:
 - org.apache.cordova.file
 - org.apache.cordova.filetransfer
 - de.sitewaerts.cordova.documentviewer
